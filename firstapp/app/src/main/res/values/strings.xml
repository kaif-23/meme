    <string name="about_Us">Android apps can be written using Kotlin, the Java programming language, and C++ languages. The Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK or an Android App Bundle.
An Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix, contains the contents of an Android app required at runtime, and it is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.
An Android App Bundle, which is an archive file with an .aab suffix, contains the contents of an Android app project, including some additional metadata that isn't required at runtime. An AAB is a publishing format and can't be installed on Android devices. It defers APK generation and signing to a later stage.</string>
